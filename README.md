# libft
the first project completed in the WeThinkCode_ course first year.
A library of useful functions created in C. The makefile will compile all the functions in the library and allow easy use in projects.
It is recreating the wheel, since it recreates many of the existing C standard library functions, however the idea is to gain a greater
understanding of how each of the functions work and allow a better grasp on the C language as a whole.
